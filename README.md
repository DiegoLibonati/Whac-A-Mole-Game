# Whac A Mole Game

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

I made a web page that allows you to play hit the `mole` but in this case it is a `rat`. Basically the user will have 60 seconds to hit the mouse as many times as possible, the mouse will be generated in a random space in the grid. If it is hit by left clicking with the mouse, you will score points.

1. CSS3
2. Typescript
3. HTML5
4. Vite
