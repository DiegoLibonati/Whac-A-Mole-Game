## Description

I made a web page that allows you to play hit the `mole` but in this case it is a `rat`. Basically the user will have 60 seconds to hit the mouse as many times as possible, the mouse will be generated in a random space in the grid. If it is hit by left clicking with the mouse, you will score points.
